# personal-budgeting-app

I've been managing my money in college through an excel sheet and wanted to create a web app that was more user friendly and efficient for my budgeting.

Started out coding this in vanilla js but after seem research Im currently learning how to use React.js to create this app so its easier to manage complexity.
